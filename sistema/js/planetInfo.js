    description: "<br><strong>Mass:</strong> Approximately 5.97 × 10²⁴ kg.<br><strong>Diameter:</strong> About 12,742 km (7,918 miles) at the equator.<br><strong>Distance from the Sun:</strong> Earth is at an average distance of approximately 149.6 million kilometers from the Sun, known as an astronomical unit (AU).<br><strong>Rotation Period:</strong> Earth completes a rotation on its axis approximately every 24 hours, resulting in the day-night cycle. <br><br>Fun Facts: <br>Earth is not a perfect sphere; it is an oblate spheroid, meaning it is slightly wider at the equator than at the poles due to its rotation. This flattening causes the diameter at the equator to be approximately 43 km larger than the polar diameter!",
